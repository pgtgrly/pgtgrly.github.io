  <p>The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;</li>

    <li>with trusted service providers who work on their behalf and have agreed to adhere to the rules in this privacy statement.</li>
